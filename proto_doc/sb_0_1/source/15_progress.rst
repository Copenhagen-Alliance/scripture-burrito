IN DBL METADATA 2.2
*******************

DBL Metadata currently supports two mechanisms for tracking translation progress. The first, which is supported by PT,
uses a top-level section to list the progress for each book:

.. code-block:: xml

    <progress>
        <book code="GEN" stage="4"/>
        <book code="EXO" stage="1"/>
        <book code="JOS" stage="2"/>
        <book code="LUK" stage="4"/>
    </progress>

There are two issues with this:

* It means another potentially long list in the metadata
* More importantly, it can only record progress for books when, in reality, progress on introductions and other para-canonical content may also be important.

The alternative mechanism, which is defined in the schema, but which has probably never been used, is to record the progress against manifest entries.

.. code-block:: xml

    <resource checksum="0e6c24ebcf1ca2e928578ab239b69687" mimeType="application/xml" size="296803" uri="release/USX_2/1CH.usx" progress=”37”/>

Progress can therefore be logged against any document in the entry, without bloating the metadata document. One possible argument against this
approach is that project tracking and manifest information may be generated by very different routes. Also, PT currently duplicates most
canonical content several times when multiple booklists are specified (but maybe we should fix the duplication of content).

PROPOSED CHANGES FOR 0.1
************************

We should pick one of these options, or come up with a new one, ensure that it will be supported by Paratext, and remove the unused options.

None.
