PROPOSED CHANGES FOR 0.1
************************

==============================
REAP-compatible isConfidential
==============================

Apparently REAP uses more than two states to represent the degree of confidentiality of a project. It would
make sense for DBL to use the same system. It will be quite important to make sure that migration does not
make previously confidential projects visible.

**************************
ISSUES TO CONSIDER FOR 0.2
**************************

None.
