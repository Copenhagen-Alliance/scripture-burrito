# Form-derived documentation

The html files in this directory were generated directly from the form trees
that form the basis of DBL 2.2 metadata editing in the Nathanael application.
Those forms "work", so the information in the files ought to be quite close to
the schema. However, the forms do not cover the whole schema (notably the parts
where the XML is generated automatically, such as the manifest) and some of the
regexes may be slightly different (because of RNC/Python differences).

In other words, these HTML files should be treated as a gentle introduction to the
schema, which remains the definitive description of DBL Metadata 2.2.
